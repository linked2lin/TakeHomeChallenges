# Conversion Rate (Python) by Lin He
## A model to predict conversion rate

## please contact https://datamasked.com/ for data and questions

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to develop a model to predict conversion rate according to user demographic. 

## Dataset
Data contains user characteristics and the target variable - conversion rate.

## Steps
The notebook applies three steps - define, discover, develop and deploy

### 1. Define:
The problem is well defined in the question.

### 2. Discover:
This step includes loading data, counting, viewing stats and assessing data quality. The data set is of high quality.

### 3. Develop:
Given limited features in this model and the decision variable being binary, one of the three proposed model was used.

## Summary
All the pairs between features and target variable were plotted to explore the relationships. It seems like numerical variables such as age and page visited play a significant role in determining if the user is going to convert or not. The random forest model developed later confirmed this insight.
